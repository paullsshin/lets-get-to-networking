### **Usage** üíª
* Users will need to do an NPM I to install all the necessary packages.
* Once the downloads are done the user can use Insomnia to connect to their terminal.
* The user can then add a new user, update, get, and delete the user they decide to create. The functionality is the same for friend and thoughts as well.
